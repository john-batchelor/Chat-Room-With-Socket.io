# Chat-Room-With-Socket.io

Using Node.js and Socket.io, this project sets up a Server and Client connection. Multiples clients can connect to the server and chat in real time. The code is quite self explainatory and is heavily commented.

This is a very small project and was created because I had some free time. Feel free to contribute to and use this code in your own projects.
